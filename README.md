To get better understanding of taxi system so the New York city improved the efficiency of in-city commutes, by using the exploratory data analysis.

The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has provided a dataset of trips made by the taxis in the New York City. The detailed trip-level data is more than just a vast list of taxi pickup and drop off coordinates.  

The records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations (location coordinates of the starting and ending points), trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, driver-reported passenger counts etc. 

The purpose of this dataset is to get a better understanding of the taxi system so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.
